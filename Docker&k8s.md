A hypervisor is like a wizard 🧙‍♂️ or software that creates virtual servers 🖥️✨ on top of physical servers 🛠️.

🎯 Two Mighty Types:
1️⃣ Type 1 (Hardware Hypervisor) 🛠️
🏋️‍♂️ Runs directly on the physical hardware.
⚡ Offers high performance & efficiency for virtualizing servers.

Examples:
VMware ESXi
Microsoft Hyper-V
Citrix XenServer
KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)

🖥️ Physical Hardware
   └── 🛠️ Type 1 Hypervisor
       ├── 🖥️ Virtual Machine 1 (OS1)
       ├── 🖥️ Virtual Machine 2 (OS2)
       └── 🖥️ Virtual Machine 3 (OS3)


2️⃣ Type 2 (Software Hypervisor) 💻
🚀 Runs as an application on an existing operating system.
🎮 Ideal for testing, development, and personal use.

🔥 Fun Fact: Hypervisors power your favorite cloud platforms 🌩️ like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud!

Examples:
VMware Workstation
Oracle VirtualBox
Parallels Desktop
QEMU

🖥️ Physical Hardware
   └── 🖥️ Host Operating System
       └── 🛠️ Type 2 Hypervisor
           ├── 🖥️ Virtual Machine 1 (OS1)
           ├── 🖥️ Virtual Machine 2 (OS2)
           └── 🖥️ Virtual Machine 3 (OS3)

Limitations of virtual machines/ server
> provisioning a virtual machine is time consuming
> Resources (CPU,memory) allocation is not dynamic
> Left over resources are given to be utilised
